PAPER  ON HARDNESS OF 
WATER  
 
Abstract : Water hardness is a common issue that affects the quality and 
usability of water in many regions worldwide. This abstract provides an 
overview of the causes, effects, and treatment methods associated with water 
hardness. Water  with high concentration of mi nerals is hard water. Water is 
essential for life. But water with very high degrees of hardness is harmful to 
health. Hardness of water can be determined by EDTA titration method. 
Extreme degree of hardness is dangerous to health. The minerals that are 
supplemented to body through water will be beneficial to health in several 
ways.  Water hardness is important to fish culture and is a commonly reported 
aspect of water quality. It is a measure of the quantity of divalent ions such as 
calcium, magnesium and/or  iron in water.  These minerals enter water sources 
through the natural leaching of rocks and minerals as well as from human 
activities such as industrial processes and the use of certain detergents.  So 
public should be educated about degrees of hardness an d its effects.  
 
Introduction : Hardness, a physio chemical property of water, is generally a 
measure of calcium and magnesium ions in water. Zinc, iron, strontium, 
aluminium, and manganese can also contribute to water hardness; however, 
they are generally present in very low concentrations. These ions enter a water 
supply by leaching from minerals of rocks and soil. Initially, water hardness was 
understood to be a measure of the capacity of water to precipitate soap,  it has 
been generally accepted  that hardness is defined as the sum of the Ca and Mg 
concentrations, determined by the EDTA titration method, and expressed in 
ppm of sodium carbonate. The extreme degrees (very soft and very hard) are 
considered as undesirable concordantly from the techn ical and health points of view, but the optimum Ca and Mg water levels are not easy to determine since 
the health requirements may not coincide with the technical ones. Health 
significance of water hardness was directly evidenced in the late 1950’s.  
 The World Health Organization says that "there does not appear to be 
any convincing evidence that water hardness  causes adverse health effects in 
humans" (WHO, 2003). In fact, the United States National Research Council has 
found that hard water can actually s erve as a dietary supplement for calcium 
and magnesium. Hard drinking water is generally not harmful to one's health , 
but can pose serious problems in industrial settings, where water hardness is 
monitored to avoid costly breakdowns in boilers, cooling tow ers, and other 
equipment that handles water. In domestic settings, hard water is often 
indicated by a lack of suds formation when soap is agitated in water, and by the 
formation of lime scale in kettles and water heaters. Wherever water hardness 
is a conce rn, water softening is commonly used to reduce hard water's adverse 
effects.  Keeping in view of all these things the present study was carried out to 
estimate the amount of hardness in the ground water of those areas.  
 Water hardness is important to fish c ulture and is commonly reported 
aspect of water quality. Calcium has an important role in the biological 
processes of fish. It is necessary for bone formation, blood clotting and other 
metabolic reactions. Fish can absorb calcium for these needs directly f rom the 
water or food. Sodium and potassium are the most important salts in fish blood 
and are critical for normal heart, nerve and muscle function. Hardness is 
commonly confused with alkalinity.  
 Hardness in water is due to the presence of dissolved salt s of calcium 
and magnesium. It is unfit for drinking, bathing, washing and it also forms 
scales in boilers. Hence it is necessary to estimate the amount of hardness 
producing substances present in the water sample. Once it is estimated, the 
amount of chemi cals required for the treatment of water can be calculated. 
The estimation of hardness is based on complexometric titration. Hardness of 
water is determined by titrating with a standard solution of ethylene diamine 
tetra acetic acid (EDTA) which is a compl exing agent. Since EDTA is insoluble in 
water, the disodium salt of EDTA is taken for this experiment. EDTA can form 
four or six coordination bonds with a metal ion. Two type of hardness is 
present in water first is temporary hardness and second is permane nt 
hardness. Temporary hardness is due to the presence of bicarbonates of 
calcium and magnesium ions. It can be easily removed by boiling. Permanent hardness is due to the presence of chlorides and sulphates of calcium and 
magnesium ions. This type of hard ness cannot be removed by boiling.  
 
Experimental Procedure :  
1. Add EDTA salt to the weighing tube and transfer the salt to the flask. 
Proceed to weight the empty weighing tube and note the values.  
2. Add 3 – 4 ml of ammonia and distilled water to the flask and  mix 
thoroughly and fill the flask with 250 ml of distilled water. Transfer this 
standard solution into the burette.  
3. In a conical flask take 25 ml of hard water, 3 ml of buffer solution and a 
pinch of Eriochrome black – T indicator. Wine red colour is obs erved 
when mixed.  
4. Note the initial reading.  
5. Titrate this standard solution against the hard water. At the end point 
colour changes from wine red to pale blue colour.  
6. Note the final reading and record it. Repeat the process till we get 
concordant value.

Hard drinking water is generally not harmful to one's health, (WHO, 2003) but 
can pose serious problems in industrial settings. Most of the people especially 
housewives dislike hard water because it does not lather well or does not taste 
good, but they may not be knowing that it may prolong their lives, and more 
especially their husband. Calcium, on e of the components of hard water, can 
be protective because it makes water less corrosive and less likely to leach toxic 
trace minerals, such as cadmium and lead, out of metal pipes. According to the 
U.S. National Academy of Sciences by 1977 there had bee n more than 50 
studies, in nine countries, that had indicated an inverse relationship between 
water hardness and mortality from cardiovascular disease . Most of the 
scientists have indicated a negative statistical association of various types of 
cancer morb idity/mortality with the hardness of water and calcium. Some 
studies correlate domestic hard water usage with increased eczema in children . 
Conclusion : Most of the people dislikes to use hard water, magnesium and 
calcium are having some protective effect o n cardiovascular mortality, the 
evidence being debated and does not prove ca usality and also the drinking water is the source of calcium and magnesium intake which are essential for 
the body.  Hence it would be better if we bring awareness among the public.
